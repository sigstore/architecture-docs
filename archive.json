In practice many (all?) of the Sigstore clients have an implicit policy of 1-of-N, since most of the bundles in the wild today contain only one inclusion promise/proof and no signed timestamps.\r\n\r\nTo improve this, I think the client spec could offer some stronger guidance:\r\n\r\n1. Continue to require that obtaining a source of signed time is **required**;\r\n2. Either an inclusion promise or a signed timestamp is a valid source of signed time;\r\n3. As a default policy, clients **should** choose one valid source of signed time available to them and use it during verification;\r\n4. Optionally, clients **may** choose to use multiple valid sources of signed time in a threshold scheme, as a non-default verification policy\r\n\r\n(The above is spitballed/maybe not precise enough \ud83d\ude42)",

          "body": "This looks good to me.\r\n\r\nOne thing I was thinking about while reviewing this is that the verifier language refers to verifying a single artifact. There could be cases where you want to verify multiple artifacts, especially if they all share the same bundle, but on the other hand expressing a policy for artifacts that do *not* share the same bundle could get quite complicated. So maybe better to leave it as-is with verifiers verifying an artifact at a time, and of course you can call the verifier multiple times with different artifacts if needed.",
